# Advent of Code 2022
My attempt at completing Advent of Code 2022 in Rust. I am completing this using Rust (2021 Edition) Stable. 

I have taken a pragmatic approach to completing these challenges, making the code as general and resiliant as I can, but also being realsitic with time constraints in my spare time. In particular, as the problem spaces for these challenges are very well constrained, and the code is generally very shallow and mostly self-contained, the majority of code lacks rigorous error handling and propagation, instead opting for `.expect()`-based error messages. 

Please see the `lidrs` crate I maintain (https://github.com/sammorrell/lidrs) as minor proof that I can do this a bit more rigorosly when it makes sense ðŸ˜….
